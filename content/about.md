Recurring monthly and weekly challenges are a great way to learn or improve a new skill, and find a community of people with shared interests. Read more about my own experience [on my blog.](https://stefanbohacek.com/project/recurring-creative-challenges/)

If you'd like to share an event I should add to my list, [please reach out](https://stefanbohacek.com/contact/)!
